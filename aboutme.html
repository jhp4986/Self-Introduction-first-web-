       <h3><storng> I was born in South Korea in January, 1994 and moved to USA when I was 16 years old but my English is not as good as you thought.
       <br>because I went to Mexico and Japan and lived in Korea for about 2 years when I was in my early 20s because of baseball...yeah..didn't study much :(
        <br><p>I used to be a Baseball-Player and I was a Pitcher. I played baseball 
        for about 14 years.<br>Of course!, my goal was to be a professional baseball player but I didn't reach that goal,
        and I failed because I had ligament-surgery on my elbow when I was 24 years old.<br>
        I had surgery, but i wanted to try until the end, so I rehabilitated but i couldn't overcome it and ...quit my baseball</p>
        <p>BUT! There's something New I want to try! <br> That's coding 👨🏻‍💻.</p>
            <span class="best">I'll do my best! and become a Great Web-Developer :).</span>
